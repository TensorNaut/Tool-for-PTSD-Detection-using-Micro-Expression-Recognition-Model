# Tool for PTSD Detection using Micro Expression Recognition Model

This project aims to develop a tool for PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) detection using a micro-expression recognition model. The tool utilizes deep learning techniques to analyze facial micro-expressions and classify them into different emotional states, which can be indicative of PTSD.

## Introduction

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a serious mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. One of the symptoms of PTSD is the presence of distinct facial micro-expressions, which can provide valuable insights for diagnosis and treatment.

This tool leverages a micro-expression recognition model trained on datasets such as CASME, CASME 2, and SAMM to detect and analyze facial micro-expressions associated with PTSD. The model is implemented using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras, and it is capable of real-time analysis of live video streams as well as pre-recorded videos.

## Features

- Real-time detection and analysis of facial micro-expressions.
- Classification of micro-expressions into different emotional states (e.g., positive, negative, surprise).
- Visualization of emotion timelines and graphical representations for analysis.
- Support for both live video streams and pre-recorded videos.
- High accuracy and robustness, validated through testing and performance analysis.

## Requirements

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow (>=2.0)
- Keras (>=2.0)
- OpenCV (>=4.0)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
